namespace Stash\Handler;

/**
 * Stash Handlers are the engines behind the Stash library. These classes handle the low level operations- retrieving,
 * storing and deleting items in the persistant cache pool. By creating new handlers developers can add new caching
 * methods to their applications with extremely minmal changes to their existing code base. This interface defines the
 * standard for those handlers and all of them are required to implement it. When writing new cache storage engines this
 * is the place to start.
 *
 * A few important notes when implementing this interface-
 *
 * * Unlike with the Stash class itself, instances of handlers are meant to be reused over and over again, allowing them
 * to avoid the overhead of repeadtedly opening and closing resources. There are times when multiple instances of an
 * engine will be created though (where a developer wants two separate cache pools for example) so static caching
 * techniques should be avoided- the StashHandler will be kept open and reused by the developers, so instance properties
 * will persist in a useful way.
 *
 * * Each storage engine must be able to handle multiple requests with the same object, meaning functions like
 * getData can be called multiple times in sequence while storeData may be mixed in at random requences, all using
 * different keys.
 *
 * * Keys are passed as arrays that represent a hierarchal 'location' where the cached data is virtually stored, with
 *  each item in the array being a deeper level of that hierarchy. In other words $key[0] is the root of the cache tree
 *  and $key[2] is the child of $key[0] + $key[1]. Each level can be both a piece of data and a parent location, which
 *  is particularly important for purge and delete operations.
