# Stash

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tedivm/Stash.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/tedivm/Stash)

Stash makes it easy to speed up your code by caching the results of expensive functions or code. Certain 
actions, like database queries or calls to external APIs, take a lot of time to run but tend to have the
same results over short periods of time. This makes it much more efficient to store the results and call
them back up later.

**NOTE:** Stash is currently being migrated from Google Code to GitHub. All documentation (which is extensive) 
can be found there ( http://code.google.com/p/stash ) while we finish the migration.
